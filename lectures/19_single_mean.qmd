## Test Statistics

What is a test statistic?

It is the value from your data that you can compare to a sampling (or comparison) distribution primarily for finding a p-value.

## Single proportion

The test statistic for a single proportion is a z-score for the standard normal N(0,1):

$$
T=\frac{\widehat{p} - p_{null}}{SE}
$$

Where $p_{null}$ is the proportion under the null hypothesis.

## Diff of Proportions

The test statistic for a difference of proportions is also a z-score for the standard normal N(0,1):

$$
T = \frac{\widehat{p_1} - \widehat{p_2} - 0}{SE}
$$

Where $\widehat{p_1} - \widehat{p_2}$ is the point estimate and 0 is the difference under the null.

## Why did we compute these?

We find the test statistics on the standard normal table of z-scores to be able to find a p-value.

We don't really need to know how to do this because we have `pnorm().`

When reading stats papers the phrase test statistic is still often given along side the p-value.

## Test for Independence

The test statistic for a test for indepence is a quantile from the chi-squared distribution:

$$
T = \sum \frac{(obs - exp)^2}{exp}
$$

Where obs is observed values and exp is expected values is the point estimate and 0 is the difference under the null.

## The test stat for $\chi^2$

The test statistic for $\chi^2$ is the same as the observed statistic.

We use it to find p-values.

# A single mean

Fictional:

We are concerned about fishing depleting fish for penguin's diets.

Last year the average weight of Adelie penguins on Togersen island was 3900 grams.

We went to Togersen Island this year and weighed some penguins.

Our data is in `penguins`.

## Penguin Sample

```{r}
Togersen_penguins <- penguins |>
  filter(island == "Torgersen")
```

Find the average weight of these penguins.

Is the difference from 3900 due to chance?

## Hypothesis test for a single mean

$$
H_0: \mu = 3900 \\
H_a: \mu \ne 3900
$$

## Conditions

### Large Independent sample

-   No extreme outliers

-   Larger than 30

or

### Small Independent sample

-   The data distribution is normal.

-   No clear outliers.

## Check our conditions

```{r}
#Sample size 
Togersen_penguins |>nrow()

# Outliers? 
Togersen_penguins |>
  ggplot()+
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=body_mass_g))
```

## What is the sampling distribution?

It could be normal... But its much better to use the Student t.

## The Student's t dist

The student t distribution is similar to the normal distribution in shape. <br>\
It has wider tails. <br>\
It is used with confidence intervals and hypothesis testing of a single mean. <br>

Unlike the normal distribution it works well for small sample sizes if the population is normal distributed.

## The parameters of a student t.

The student t takes just one parameter

<br>

`df = degree of freedom.`

<br>

$df= n-1$

## limit of t-dist is normal

As $\text{lim}_{df \rightarrow \infty} t_{dist} \rightarrow N(\mu=0,sigma=1)$

![https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution#/media/File:Student_t_pdf.svg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/41/Student_t_pdf.svg)

## t-dist is better than the normal for sampling distributions.

You can use either if:

::: incremental
-   If the sample size is large or underlying distribution is normal

-   Population standard deviation is known $\sigma$

<br>

-   But if population sd $\sigma$ is unknown or n is small use student t.

-   In general t distribution works, normal less so.
:::

## The sampling distribution for sample mean:

$\mu \sim \text{t}_{df}$

<br>

The mean of the t-dist is 0.

<br>

The mean of your sample is $\bar{x}$ and the standard error is $SE = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$

## What is df?

::: incremental
-   The number of values that can vary when finding a mean.

<br>

-   Consider that you find a mean of 3 numbers. x,y,and z.

<br>

-   If I tell you the mean is 10, you can guess any two numbers and the third is forced.

<br>

-   This mean would have 2 degrees of freedom.
:::

## test statistic for a mean

We've skipped discussing most of the test statistics, because of `pnorm()`.

<br>

Ideally

$$ T = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}}$$

or more realistically:

$$ T = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu}{\frac{s_x}{\sqrt{n}}}$$

## Let's finish our hypothesis test

## You can make confidence intervals with the student t.

Its the same as doing it with the normal distribution.

Except you use a t\* score instead of z\*score.

$$ \bar{x} \pm t^* SE$$

## Lets make a 90% CI for our penguin data.

## Hypothesis testing on a single mean

Awesome Auto data set. ùëõ = 5, $\bar{x}$= 14600, and $s_x$= 7765.31. Suppose you hear that the Awesome Auto dealership typically sells cars for 18000. You decide to test this claim.

-   Write the hypotheses in symbols.

-   Check conditions, then calculate the test statistic, ùëá , and the associated degrees of freedom.

-   Find and interpret the p-value in this context.

-   What is the conclusion of the hypothesis test when using ùõº = 0.05?

## The `t.test()`

R, of course, can make this test easy if you are working from a vector of values (x) (instead of sample statistics).

<br>

t.test(x= , alternative= , mu=)

## Awesome auto revisited

Suppose the awesome auto data was:

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
awesome_auto <- c(15000, 26000, 6000, 17000, 9000)
```

```{r}

t.test(awesome_auto,
       alternative = "less",
       mu=18000)
```

## Try one:

Georgianna claims that in a small city renowned for its music school, the average child takes less than 5 years of piano lessons. We have a random sample of 20 children from the city, with a mean of 4.6 years of piano lessons and a standard deviation of 2.2 years.

-   Evaluate Georgianna's claim (or that the opposite might be true) using a hypothesis test.

## Another one with `t.test()`

The 2017 Toyota Prius Prime has a MPG_e = 54. Consider the `prius_mpg` data set in the openintro package.

<br>

Test the hypothesis that the actual MPG is greater than 54.

<br>

Consider Conditions, but do the test either way and we'll discuss conditions afterwards.

<br>

Hint: use `prius_mpg$_____` to take just one column from the data.

## My output

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)

t.test(x=prius_mpg$average_mpg, alternative = "greater", mu = 54)
```

## Bootstrapping

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
#| 
library(infer)

x_bar <- mean(prius_mpg$average_mpg)

prius_randomization <-prius_mpg |>
  specify(response = average_mpg)|>
  hypothesise(null= "point", mu = 54) |>
  generate(reps = 5000)|>
  calculate(stat = "mean")


```

## Graph and pvalue

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
prius_randomization |>  visualise()+
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = x_bar, direction = "greater")
  
prius_randomization |>
  get_pvalue(obs_stat = x_bar, direction = "greater")

```
