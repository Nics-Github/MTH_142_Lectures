## Hypothesis Testing with p-values

1.  Write notation

2.  Check Conditions

3.  Build Theoretical Distributions with **assumed parameter**.

4.  Find the probability of such a sample statistic.

## The question we are trying to answer:

If the null hypothesis is true, how likely is it that we would have gotten the statistic from our sample?

## Example from lab 4

If $H_0 : p = 0.08$ how likely is it we would have gotten $\widehat{p} = 0.0653$

You all found that to be very unlikely from your bootstrap distribution.

## Note on alpha $\alpha$ :

$\alpha$ is a cut off value. If the p-value is larger than $\alpha$ we say $\widehat{p}$ is likely (Fail to reject $H_0$), smaller than alpha $\widehat{p}$ is unlikely (reject $H_0$).

-   $\alpha$ shows the strength of our evidence.

-   weak evidence $\alpha = 0.1$ or higher.

-   moderate evidence $\alpha =0.05$

-   strong evidence $\alpha = 0.01$

Choosing alpha involves making trade offs that are beyond the scope of this class.

## But we can make the wrong decision

These are just probabilities. They could be wrong.

-   We could reject $H_0$ if it is true. (Type 1)

or

-   We could fail to reject $H_0$ if it is false. (Type 2)

## Decision Errors

## On Lab 4

Could we have made an error?

## Board work problem

[16.3](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/inference-one-prop#chp16-exercises)

-   ignore d.

-   Make your own bootstrapped null distribution. `set.seed(2024)`

-   Find the pvalue.

-   Make conclusion.

-   Also consider which error could have been reached.
