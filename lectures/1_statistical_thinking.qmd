## The Data

```{r}
library(openintro)
loan50
```

## Vocabulary

```{r}
head(loan50,2)
```

::: incremental
-   Data Frame

-   Tidy Data

-   Variables

-   Variable Types

## More on variable types:

## A mean

```{r}
mean(loan50$annual_income)
```

## Explanatory and Response

Consider the variables emp_length and annual_income.

Does the length of someone's employment explain their income?

## A scatter plot

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = loan50, mapping = aes(x=emp_length, y = annual_income))+
  geom_point()
```

## Observational study or experiment.

Experiment - Has some control or non-treatment variable.

Observational - No control.

It is harder to say that x causes y without a control.
