## The Law of Large numbers

The theoretical probability of getting a heads is 0.5 on a coin.

Let's test it empirically.

[Flip a coin](https://www.random.org/coins/)

[Visualize the law of large numbers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pWXdJkCfo8P-oiseqJ7tAh9sXHuDjTPK3SKWNWvx_Bk/edit?usp=sharing)

## Empirical Probability

-   We just found the probability of flipping a coin empirically.

-   We know what it was in theory. ( 0.5)

-   Today we will discuss theoretical probabilities.

## Probability

> The probability of an event is the proportion of times we would see the event occur if the process could happen an infinite number of times.

[Consider a fair six sided die.](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=six+sided+die)

Event A = Rolling a 4.

A random variable X might be:

-   X\~The number that shows up on a die.

## Rolling a 4

There are 6 possible outcomes so the

-   Sample space = {1,2,3,4,5,6 } = $\Omega$

We want 1 outcome of the 6.

-   P(Rolling a 4) = P( X = 4) = $\frac{1}{6}$

## Not rolling a 4.

We want 5 outcomes of the 6.

$\Omega = \{1,2,3,4,5,6 \}$

-   P(Not Rolling a 4) = $P( X \ne 4) = \frac{5}{6}$

This is called the complement and is denoted $\bar{A}$

## An event and its complement

An event and its complement sum to 1.

$P(A) + P(\bar{A}) = 1$

## You try

[We are rolling two fair die.](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=six+sided+die)

1.  What is the theortical probability their sum is 7? Call this event B.

[Here is the sample space](https://spreadsheetsolving.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/techsmithwor6cb3.png) [^1]

[^1]: https://spreadsheetsolving.com/probabilities-dice-simulations/

2.  Write the event and the probability notation.

3.  Find the compliment of the value above.

## Disjoint (Mutually Exclusive) Events

> Two events that cannot happen simultaneously.

Consider the single six sided die.

A = Rolling a 3

B = Rolling an even number

-   $P(A \text{ and } B) = 0$

-   $P(A \text{ or } B) = \frac{1}{6}+\frac{3}{6}$

## What is disjoint with?

::: incremental
-   A = Flipping heads on a coin

-   B = Going to class

-   C = Eating a cheeseburger
:::

## What is not disjoint with?

-   A = Flipping heads on a coin

-   B = Going to class

-   C = Eating a cheeseburger

## Independence

> Two outcomes are independent if knowing the outcome of one gives no useful information about the other.

-   I flip a tails on a coin. Does that tell me the probability of the next flip?

-   I pull an Ace of Spades from a deck but don't replace it. Does that tell me about the probability of the next card I pull?

-   One person in class is left handed does that effect the probability of another person being left handed.

## An incomplete list of formulas

-   Addition Rule $P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B)$

-   Rules for probability distributions.

-   Multiplication rule for independence. $P(A \text{ and } B) = P(A) \times P(B)$

You've read chapter 3.1 and made note of these formulas.
