## Hypothesis Testing with p-values

1.  Write notation

2.  Check Conditions

3.  Build Theoretical Distributions with **assumed parameter**.

4.  Find the probability of a sample statistic.

## The question we are trying to answer:

If the null hypothesis is true, how likely is it that we would have gotten the statistic from our sample?

## Example from difference of props

If $H_0 : p_1 = p_2$ how likely is it we would have gotten $\widehat{p}_1- \widehat{p}_2 = 0.13$

With a p-value of 0.086 found it to be likely that we would have gotten 0.13.

## Note on alpha $\alpha$ :

$\alpha$ is a cut off value. If the p-value is larger than $\alpha$ we say $\widehat{p}$ is likely (Fail to reject $H_0$), smaller than alpha $\widehat{p}$ is unlikely (reject $H_0$).

-   $\alpha$ shows the strength of our evidence.

-   weak evidence $\alpha = 0.1$ or higher.

-   moderate evidence $\alpha =0.05$

-   strong evidence $\alpha = 0.01$

Choosing alpha involves making trade offs that are beyond the scope of this class.

## Making a wrong decision

These are just probabilities. They could be wrong.

-   We could reject $H_0$ if it is true. (Type 1)

or

-   We could fail to reject $H_0$ if it is false. (Type 2)
