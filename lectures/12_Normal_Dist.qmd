# Normal Distribution

The normal distribution has a symmetric bell shaped curve

![](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/13-foundations-mathematical_files/figure-html/simpleNormal-1.png)

## The Standard Normal

Has a mean $\mu = 0$ and standard deviation $\sigma = 1$

> Notation $X\sim N(\mu,\sigma)$ means the random variable X has a normal distribution.

It is where z-score are based on.

## Very Short history lesson.

::: incremental
-   Long long ago before computers existed people wanted to calculate probabilities from z-scores.

-   The table was first made by [Christian Kramp in 1799.](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/233356/who-created-the-first-standard-normal-table)

-   It was improved upon ( [for more read this](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27643700)).

-   The end of the lesson.

-   [Let's use the ancient table](https://ztable.io/)

## Brushtail possum

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Trichosurus_vulpecula_1.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:JJ_Harrison)

## Problem from text:

> Head lengths of brushtail possums follow a nearly normal distribution (it is also a continuous random variable) with mean 92.6 mm and standard deviation 3.6 mm. Compute the Z scores for possums with head lengths of 95.4 mm and 85.8 mm.
>
> Which of the two brushtail possum observations in the previous guided practice is more *unusual*?

## Z-scores by hand

$X \sim N(\mu = 92.6 , \sigma = 3.6)$

But there is no table for this distribution.

Use this formula to standardize so we can use the table:

$$Z = \frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}$$ Where x is the value of interest.

Use the z-score to find the value on the table.

## Z-scores with R

We don't need to find a z-score any more, but we still talk about them.

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE

pnorm(q=95.4 ,m = 92.6, s = 3.6 )
```

This finds the probability to the left of q.

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE

pnorm(q=95.4 ,m = 92.6, s = 3.6, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

## Visualize with `openintro` package

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE

library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
library(infer)
pnorm(q=95.4 ,m = 92.6, s = 3.6 )
normTail(m = 92.6, s= 3.6, L = 95.4)
```

## Calculus

The function f(x) below defines the pdf of the bell curve.

$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}}  e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2 } $$

![](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/13-foundations-mathematical_files/figure-html/simpleNormal-1.png)

## What we really care about:

The probability is the area under the curve and can be represented as:

$$ \int_a^b \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}}  e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2 } dx $$

warning: integrating this is tricky.

## Reminder:

Draw the curve and the integral that goes with the possum area under the normal distribution.

## The Empirical rule.

Draw a picture of the standard normal bell curve. Mark -1 and 1 $\sigma$ away from the mean.

Using R find the probability we get values between -1 and 1. shade your picture.

Repeat this process for \[-2,2\] and \[-3,3\].

## Practice

From the text:

> SAT scores closely follow the normal model with mean Î¼=1500 and standard deviation Ïƒ=300. About what percent of test takers score 900 to 2100? What percent score between 1500 and 2100

## Practice 2

> Shannon is a randomly selected SAT taker, and nothing is known about Shannon's SAT aptitude. What is the probability that Shannon scores at least 1630 on their SATs?

## Practice 3

> Edward earned a 1400 on their SAT. What is their percentile?

> What percent did better than Edward?

## `qnorm` outputs quantiles from percents.

```{r}
#|echo: TRUE

pnorm(q = 95.4 ,m = 92.6, s = 3.6 )

qnorm(p = 0.78165, m = 92.6, s = 3.6)
```

`qnorm()` is for finding quantiles `pnorm()` is for finding percents

## Practice 4

[OI 4.2 OI 4.4](https://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~iruczins/teaching/books/2019.openintro.statistics.pdf#chapter.4)

## Compute the mean and sd

Note on notation.

$X \sim N(\mu = 92.6 , \sigma = 3.6)$

or

$X \sim N(\bar{x} = 92.6 , s= 3.6)$\
We estimate $\sigma$ with *s* - The sample proportion.

```{r}
# Sample standard deviation

possum$head_l |> 
  sd()

# Sample mean
possum$head_l |> 
  mean()

```
