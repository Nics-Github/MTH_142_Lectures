[Open Intro Statistics 4.1 Normal Distribution](https://nics-github.github.io/MTH_142_Lectures/2019.openintro.statistics.pdf)

## Normal Distribution

The normal distribution has a symmetric bell shaped curve

```{r}
library(openintro)
normTail()

```

The picture above is for the so called standard normal distribution.

## The Standard Normal

Has a mean $\mu = 0$ and standard deviation $\sigma = 1$

> Notation $X\sim N(\mu,\sigma)$ means the random variable X has a normal distribution.

It is what z-scores are based on. (There are other distributions).

## Very Short history lesson.

::: incremental
-   Long long ago before computers existed people wanted to calculate probabilities from z-scores.

-   The table was first made by [Christian Kramp in 1799.](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/233356/who-created-the-first-standard-normal-table)

-   It was improved upon ( [for more read this](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27643700)).

-   [We will not use the ancient table](https://ztable.io/)

## Brushtail possum

[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Trichosurus_vulpecula_1.jpg)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:JJ_Harrison)

## Problem from text:

> Head lengths of brushtail possums follow a nearly normal distribution (it is also a continuous random variable) with mean 92.6 mm and standard deviation 3.6 mm. Compute the \[percentiles\] for possums with head lengths of 95.4 mm and 85.8 mm.
>
> Which of the two brushtail possum observations in the previous guided practice is more *unusual*?

## Picture the distribution

$X \sim N(\mu = 92.6 , \sigma = 3.6)$

```{r}
normTail(m=92.6,s=3.6)

```

## The graph for the first possum

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE

normTail(m=92.6,s=3.6, L = 95.4)
```

## The graph for the second possum

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE

normTail(m=92.6,s=3.6, L = 85.8)
```

## Calculate percentiles with R

We use `pnorm()` to find percentiles.

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE

pnorm(q=85.8 ,m = 92.6, s = 3.6 )
```

This finds the probability to the left of q.

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE

pnorm(q=85.8 ,m = 92.6, s = 3.6, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

## Visualize with `openintro` package

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE

library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)

pnorm(q=85.8 ,m = 92.6, s = 3.6, lower.tail = FALSE )
normTail(m = 92.6, s= 3.6, U = 85.8)
```

## Calculus

The function f(x) below defines the pdf of the bell curve.

$$ f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}}  e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2 } $$

![](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/foundations-mathematical_files/figure-html/fig-simpleNormal-1.png)

## What we really care about:

The probability is the area under the curve and can be represented as:

$$ \int_a^b \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}}  e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2 } dx $$

We will not be computing these values by hand.

## Reminder:

Draw the curve and the integral that goes with the possum area under the normal distribution.

## The Empirical rule.

Draw a picture of the standard normal bell curve. Mark -1 and 1 $\sigma$ away from the mean.

Using R find the probability we get values between -1 and 1. shade your picture.

Repeat this process for \[-2,2\] and \[-3,3\].

## Practice

From the text:

> SAT scores closely follow the normal model with mean μ=1500 and standard deviation σ=300. About what percent of test takers score 900 to 2100? What percent score between 1500 and 2100

## Practice 2

> Shannon is a randomly selected SAT taker, and nothing is known about Shannon's SAT aptitude. What is the probability that Shannon scores at least 1630 on their SATs?

## Practice 3

> Edward earned a 1400 on their SAT. What is their percentile?

> What percent did better than Edward?

## `qnorm` outputs quantiles from percents.

```{r}
#|echo: TRUE

pnorm(q = 85.8 ,m = 92.6, s = 3.6 )

qnorm(p = 0.02945336, m = 92.6, s = 3.6)
```

`qnorm()` is for finding quantiles `pnorm()` is for finding percentiles.

## Practice 4

[OI 4.2](https://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~iruczins/teaching/books/2019.openintro.statistics.pdf#chapter.4) d

## Compute the mean and sd

Note on notation.

$X \sim N(\mu = 92.6 , \sigma = 3.6)$

or

$X \sim N(\bar{x} = 92.6 , s= 3.6)$\
We estimate $\sigma$ with *s* - The sample proportion.

```{r}
# Sample standard deviation

sd(possum$head_l)

# Sample mean
mean(possum$head_l)
  

```
