## Blue whales

Study: [In Breeding in blue whales.](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/23/science/blue-whale-genome.html)

## Some info on Blue whales:

n = 3500

Four subspecies[^1]:

[^1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_whale

-   Northern

-   Northern Indian Ocean

-   Pygmy blue whale

-   Antarctic subspecies

## Population vs Sample

The *population* is all the Blue Whale left in the world

The *sample* is the 26 Blue whale that have washed ashore.

## Sampling Strategies

1.  Simple random sampling

2.  Stratified sampling

3.  Convience sample

## Experimental Design

1.  Control vs Treatment

2.  Randomization - Effect of Confounding Variables.

3.  Replication - Repeat experiments have the similar results.

## Experiments vs Observational Studies

1.  Experiments have a control

    a.  Use for causal conclusions

2.  Observational Studies often gather information

    a.  Cannot be used for casual conclusions

## Explanatory and Response

If we suspect a causal relationship we have an explanatory (independent) and response variable (dependent).

-   Negative relationship

-   Positive Relationship

-   No Relationship

## Confounder Variables

Variables that have an unanticipated effect on the study.

## You try

[Chapter 2 2.1](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/data-design#chp2-exercises)[2 and 2.20](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/data-design#sec-chp2-exercises)

## Solution 2.12

a\. Observational Study. There is no control group.

b\. No we cannot see for sure if there is a link between stress and muscle cramps.

c\. It could be that (perhaps) there is a link between excess coffee and lack of sleep that causes cramps

## Solution 2.20

a\. This was an experiment there is a control group (placebo).

b\. Explanatory is the quantity of vitamin C. The response is cold duration

c\. The patients were blind during their treatment, all pills look the same

d\. The study is not double blind as the nurses knew which patient got which pill

e\. A Confounding variable is whether a patient takes the pill.
