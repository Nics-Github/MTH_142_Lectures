-   Northern

-   Northern Indian Ocean

-   Pygmy blue whale

-   Antarctic subspecies

## Sampling

1.  Simple random sampling

2.  Stratified sampling

3.  Cluster sample

## Experimental Design

1.  Control vs Treatment

2.  Randomization - Effect of Confounding Variables.

3.  Replication - Repeat experiments have the similar results.

## Experiments vs Observational Studies

1.  Experiments have a control

    a.  Use for causal conclusions

2.  Observational Studies often gather information

    a.  Cannot be used for casual conclusions

## Explanatory Variable

If we suspect a causal relationship we have an explanatory and response variable.

-   Negative relationship

-   Positive Relationship

-   No Relationship

## Confounder Variables

Variables that have an unanticipated effect on the study.
