## Statistical Inference

Usually there is math or computers involved with Statistical Inference.

But let's skip those for now.

## My sample mean from the google sheet is:

**Tell me about my sample mean.**

## Results

::: incremental
-   What did we observe?

-   Does this claim seem reasonable?

-   Should we accept/reject the claim?

-   What range of values would we say is reasonably close to the

-   claim?
:::

What could be improved about our sampling methods?

How would we do that?

Is it possible?

## Notation

## Sampling

Our population -

Our sample -

## Future Problems

::: incremental
-   How would we find a range of values that are reasonably close to a claim for other scenarios?

-   Different populations (heights of flowers, heights of fifth graders, ...)

-   Different sample sizes

-   Different claims (life expectancy, salary, proportion of SDS majors, proportion of credit card owners)
