## This is a bonus lecture

This is a lecture to explain the math behind linear regression. 

It is not necessary to watch it and you do not need it to complete the course. 

## We will do three things

1.  Find the slope of the linear model using standard deviations
2.  Make the linear model considering $\overline{x}$ and $\overline{y}$
3.  Find $R^2$ from a simple ratio of the $s_y$ and $s_e$

## Find slope of the linear model

::: incremental
-   $b=\frac{s_y}{s_x}r$

-   $s_y$ is the sample standard deviation in the y values.

-   $s_x$ is the sample standard deviation in the x values.

-   $r$ is the correlation coefficient.

-   We know these values from the last video.

## Recall

We can get our std.errors and r:

```{r tidy-model}
#| echo: TRUE

cats |>
  summarize(
    r = cor( Hwt, Bwt ),
    r2 =  (cor( Hwt, Bwt ))^2,
    sd_y = sd(Hwt),
    sd_x = sd(Bwt)
  )

```

## We are lucky

To find the sample standard deviation in the past people had to use this:

## Slope calculation

$m = b_1 = \frac{s_y}{s_x} r=\frac{2.434}{0.485}(0.804)=4.035$

We still don't know how to find `r`

## The means are on the regression line.

$\overline{x}$ and $\overline{y}$ are on the regression line $\hat{y}$

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE
cats |>
  summarize(
    mean_y = mean(Hwt),
    mean_x = mean(Bwt)
  )
```

## Solve for the intercept

Now we plug everything into the equation of a line and solve for $b_0$

I'm rounding for ease.

$\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1 x$

$10.631 = b_0 + 4.035 (2.724)$

$10.631 = b_0 + 10.991$

$- 0.36 = b_0$

So our line is: $\hat{y} = - 0.36 + 4.03 x$ or

$\widehat{Hwt} = -0.36+ 4.03 \text{Bwt}$

## Those are the same numbers we had before

```{r}
cat_model <-lm(Hwt ~ Bwt , cats)
cat_model

```

## Standard Deviation of Residuals

```{r}
#| echo: TRUE

cat_model_aug <- augment(cat_model)
tidy(cat_model_aug)
```

## We are lucky again

To find the standard deviation in the past people had to use this:

![](images/sd_equation.png){fig-align="center"}

## To calculate $R^2$

The book shows an equivalent method to do this. Using SST and SSE.

$r^2=0.65=65\%$

"65% in the variation of Heart Weight can be explained by the Body Weight"

Rounding again for ease.

$R^2 = \frac{s_y-s_e}{s_y} = \frac{2.4^2-1.4^2}{2.4^2} \approx 0.65$

$r=\sqrt{0.65}\approx 0.80$
