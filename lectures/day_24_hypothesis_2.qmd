# Hypothesis Testing with Confidence Intervals

Review:

We've done hypothesis testing with Confidence intervals

1.  Write notation

2.  Check Conditions

3.  Build Confidence Interval around **sample statistic**.

4.  Check if null hypothesis is in confidence interval.

# Hypothesis Testing with p-values

We've done hypothesis testing with Confidence intervals

1.  Write notation

2.  Check Conditions

3.  Build Theoretical Distributions with **assumed parameter**.

4.  Find the probability of such a sample statistic.

# The question we are trying to answer:

If the null hypothesis is true, how likely is it that we would have gotten the statistic from our sample?

# Example 1.

16.1: Do aliens exist? In May 2021, YouGov asked 4,839 adult Great Britain residents whether they think aliens exist, and if so, if they have or have not visited Earth.

-   In the survey 22% responded "I think they exist, and have visited Earth,"

-   28% responded "I think they exist, but have not visited Earth,"

-   29% responded "I do not think they exist," and 22% responded "Don't know."

You want to evaluate if more than a quarter (25%) of Great Britain adults think aliens do not exist.

# Example 2.

16.28 Nearsighted children. Nearsightedness (myopia) is a common vision condition in which you can see objects near to you clearly, but objects farther away are blurry. It is believed that nearsightedness affects about 8% of all children. In a random sample of 194 children, 21 are nearsighted. Using a mathematical model, conduct a hypothesis test for the following question: do these data provide evidence that the 8% value is inaccurate?

# In this class:

-   We'll make confidence intervals from statistics. (Including hypothesis tests with confidence intervals, i.e. use $\hat{p}$ to estimate the SE of a porportion\*)

-   We'll do hypothesis tests with the assumed mean/proportion and sample statistics if needed.

-   We'll default to $\alpha = 0.05$

\*This is not the only option.

# Note on alpha:

-   alpha shows the strength of our evidence.

-   weak evidence $\alpha = 0.1$ or higher.

-   moderate evidence $\alpha =0.05$

-   strong evidence $\alpha = 0.01$

Choosing alpha involves making trade offs that are beyond the scope of this class.
