## Probability Functions

$0<P(x_i)<1$

$\sum_i P(x_i) = 1$

## Process vs Variable

+-----------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Random Process              | Random Variable                   |
+=============================+===================================+
| Rolling a two six sided die | X = Sum of faces                  |
+-----------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Flip a coin 10 times        | X = \# Number of Tails            |
+-----------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Body Dimensions             | X = Foot size                     |
|                             |                                   |
|                             | Y = Neck Circumference Z = Height |

## Random variables

::: incremental
-   Are like functions that map onto the real line

-   Often given the names X, Y, and Z

-   Capital X is the name of the variable

-   Lowercase x is the value the variable takes

-   Type of Random variables:

    -   Continuous Random Variables

    -   Discrete Random Variables
:::

## Discrete Random Variables

Get a Probability Mass Function

States their probability of any value of x

-   Example: Value of face on a die

## Continuous Random Variables

Get a Probability Density Function

This states there probability for any value less than or grater than little x.

-   Height

## Expectation

Expectation is another word for average.

::: incremental
-   It is $E[X] = \sum_i P(x_i) x_i$

-   Let's make a probability model for X = The value on the face of a dice.

-   Let's graph the model.

-   Then let's calculate its expectation.
:::

## You try

Write the random variable.

Find the expectation.

Write the probability model (as a table or graph).
