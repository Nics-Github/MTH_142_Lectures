# Compare two proportions

Is there a difference between the two proportions?

## Similar to CI for one prop.

The following is from chapter 17 in the text:

The difference $\hat{p}_1−\hat{p}_2$ can be modeled using a normal distribution when

*Independence Extended:* The data are independent within and between the two groups.

*Success-failure condition.* The success-failure condition holds for both groups, where we check successes and failures in each group separately.

## Mean and SE

$\hat{p}_1−\hat{p}_2 \sim N(\hat{p}_1−\hat{p}_2,\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1(1−\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} +\frac{\hat{p}_2(1−\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}})$

mean = $\hat{p}_1−\hat{p}_2$

Standard Error = $\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1(1−\hat{p}_1)}{n} +\frac{\hat{p}_2(1−\hat{p}_2)}{n}}$

## Consider the cpr data.

```{r}
#| include: FALSE
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
```

![](/gfx/cpr.png) \## Two groups

```{r}
ggplot(cpr, aes(x = group, fill = outcome))+
geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

## Let's make a 95% CI
