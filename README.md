This in a collection of lectures for an Introductory Statistics with Technology (called MTH 192: Computation Statistics) course taught at Holyoke Community College.

The course is taught online/in person with aid of My Open Math for graded problem sets. 

The text is [Intro to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) by Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel and Jordan Hardin. 

I use the R statistical software in this course along with the openintro, tidyverse, and a bit of infer packages. 

Topics covered include:

- Introduction to R
- Variable Types
- Summary Statistics
- Probability
- The Central Limit Theorem
- Inference through mathematical methods on both one and two means and proportions
- Confidence Intervals
- ANOVA 
- Linear Regression (if Time Permits).
