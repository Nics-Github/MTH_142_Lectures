This in a collection of lectures for an introductory Statistics with Technology course taught at Holyoke Community College. 

The course is taught online with aid of My Open Math for graded problem sets. 

The text is [Intro to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) by Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel and Jordan Hardin. 

I use the R statistical software in this course along with the openintro, tidyverse, and infer packages. 

Topics covered include:

Introduction to R
Variable Types
Summary Statistics
Probability
The Central Limit Theorem
Inference through mathematical methods on both one and two means and proportions
Inference with simulation
Confidence Intervals
Linear Regression
and ANOVA if Time Permits.
