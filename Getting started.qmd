# Tour of Rstudio

To help remember all of the things we need for this class, I’ve made a cheat
sheet. 

Let’s reference it to do the following:

-   Make/knit your first .Rmd
-   Keep yourself organized
-   Focus on the name of the file’s spacing
-   Renaming a file
-   Downloading file from Rstudio.
-   Uploading a file to Rstudio.
-   Copying and pasting plain text.
-   Taking a screen shot

Console vs. Rmarkdown

-   Scratch work can be done in the console
-   Do homework calculation in an .rmd to save your work.
-   R Assignments knit in markdown

Grey Chunk vs white space
-   Spacing in chunk
-   Chunk titles

Practice
-   Make/knit second .Rmd file.
-   Delete all the default stuff below the YAML.
-   Add a chunk to add some numbers together.
-   Save it as practice.rmd
-   Knit your markdown file as .pdf.
-   Download file
