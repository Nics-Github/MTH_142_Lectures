## Cats' hearts

## A big heart may cause problems

Finding the size of a cat's heart is hard.

Estimate with a model a model.

## Data from the 40s

This data cites [this source,](https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/15253/1/211.pdf) which you may be inclined to look over.

```{r}
#| code-fold: show

#install.packages("MASS")
#library(MASS)
cats <- read_csv("cats.csv")
```

## Look at data

```{r}
?cats
tail(cats,6)
```

## Which variable is which?

Which should be the predictor and response variables?

## Plot

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(tidyverse)

ggplot(data = cats, aes(Bwt, Hwt))+
  geom_point(aes(color=Sex) )+
  xlab("Body Weight in Kg") +
  ylab("Heart Weight in Grams")

```

## Describe Trend

-   Shape

-   Direction

-   Strength

## Add a regression line

and some labels.

```{r}
ggplot(data = cats, aes(x = Bwt, y = Hwt))+
  geom_point(aes(color=Sex) )+
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) +
  xlab("Body Weight in Kg") +
  ylab("Heart Weight in Grams")
```

## Find correlation coefficient

```{r}
summarize(.data= cats , r = cor(Bwt, Hwt, use="complete.obs"))
```

## Find the coefficents

```{r}
#install.packages("broom")
library(broom)
cat_model <- lm(Hwt ~ Bwt, data = cats)
tidy(cat_model)
```

## The Equation

Intercept is the y-intercept of our linear model ($\beta_0 = -0.36$).

The number next to Bwt is the slope ($\beta_1 = 4.03$).

The equations is: $$
\hat{y} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x \\
\text{or} \\
\widehat{Hwt} = -0.36 + 4.03 \times Bwt $$

## Summary

![](images/lm_cats_1_predictor.png) Stolen from Prof Kurtz Garcia at Smith College

## Interpretation

Slope: For every *kilogram* increase in body weight we expect a 4.03 *gram* increase in the heart weight.

Intercept: If we found a cat they weighed nothing its heart would be -0.36 grams?

## More Complete outputs

```{r}
# Alternative to tidy()
summary(cat_model)
```

## You try: 

::: incremental
-   If a cat weighs 3.5 kg how large a heart would we expect?

-   Can we estimate the heart size for a 5kg cat?

    -   Caution against extrapolation.
:::

## Solution: 

The equation for the line is

$\widehat{Hwt} = -0.36 + 4.03 \times Bwt $

Plug in 3.5 we get

$\widehat{Hwt} = -0.36 + 4.03 \times 3.5 \\
\widehat{Hwt} = 13.745 \approx 13.7
$

# Residuals

Residuals are the difference in the observed values and the predicted value.

$$e = y - \hat{y}$$

```{r}
#| echo: FALSE

ggplot(cats, aes(x = Bwt, y = Hwt))+
  geom_point(aes(color=Sex) )+
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) +
  xlab("Body Weight in Kg") +
  ylab("Heart Weight in Grams")

```

## You try:  calculate a residual

There is a cat in this data that has a heart weight of 11.7 grams and a body weight of 3.5 kilograms. Calculate the residual for this cat.

## Solution: 

The residual is calculated $$e = y - \hat{y}$$

We previously found the value of $\hat{y} = 13.7$ and we are told $y=11.7$ So we need to subtract those two values to get

$$e = y - \hat{y}\\
e = 11.7-13.7\\
e = -2$$

## Solution with R functions

```{r}
predict(object =  cat_model, 
        newdata = data.frame(Bwt = 3.5)
        )
```
