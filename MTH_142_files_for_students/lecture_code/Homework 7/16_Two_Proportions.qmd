## Read before hand

Read [chapter 17](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/inference-two-props) on inference with two proportions. 

## Libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
```

# Difference of proportions

## Two proportions

Maybe we want to directly compare two proportions.

Consider a difference of proportions.

-   Confidence Interval

-   Hypothesis Test

## Compare two proportions

Is there a difference between the two proportions?

## Similar to CI for one prop.

The following is from chapter 17 in the text:

The difference $\hat{p}_1−\hat{p}_2$ can be modeled using a normal distribution when

-   *Independence Extended:* The data are independent within and between the two groups.

-   *Success-failure condition.* The success-failure condition holds for both groups, where we check successes and failures in each group separately.

## Mean and SE

$p_1−p_2 \sim N(\hat{p}_1−\hat{p}_2,\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1(1−\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} +\frac{\hat{p}_2(1−\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}})$

mean = $\hat{p}_1−\hat{p}_2$

Standard Error = $\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1(1−\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} +\frac{\hat{p}_2(1−\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}$

## Consider the cpr data.

```{r}
#| include: FALSE
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
```

## Data Distribution

```{r}
ggplot(cpr, aes(x = group, fill = outcome))+
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

## Make a 95% Confidence Interval

We want to try to capture the true difference in proportions.

$$
\hat{p}_1−\hat{p}_2  \pm z_{\frac{\alpha}{2}} \times SE
$$

We expect 95% of the CIs to capture the true difference.

Check conditions first:

-   *Independence Extended*

-   *Success-failure condition*

## Find $\hat{p}$ and SE

$\hat{p}_1 = \frac{11}{50} = 0.22$

$\hat{p}_2 = \frac{14}{40} \approx 0.35$

$\hat{p_2} - \hat{p_1} = 0.13$

$SE = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1}+\frac{\hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}} \approx 0.095$

```{r}
p_1 = 0.22
p_2 = 0.35
p_2-p_1
SE = sqrt(p_1*(1-p_1)/50+p_2*(1-p_2)/40)
SE
```

$Z = 1.96$

## The distribution is 

${p}_1−{p}_2 \sim N(0.13,0.095)$

## The 95% CI

```{r}
Z = 1.96

# "Lower Bound"
p_2-p_1 - Z* SE

# "Upper Bound"
p_2-p_1 + Z* SE


```

## Interpretation 

We are 95 % confident that the true difference in the proportion of people who survived using the two treatments is between -0.06 and 0.32. Note that zero is in this interval. It is possible that there is no difference in the survival rates.

## Let's do a Hypothesis Test

We'll use the same data above

$$
H_0: p_1 = p_2 \\
H_a:p_1 \ne p_2 
$$

$$
\alpha = 0.05
$$

Check conditions:

-   *Independence Extended*

-   *Success-failure condition*

## pooled groups

There is one difference when doing the hypothesis test. We use a pooled statistic when calculating the standard error.

The book uses $\widehat{p}_{pool} = \frac{\text{total successes from both groups}}{\text{total from both groups}}$

If conditions with the pooled group then

$\hat{p}_1−\hat{p}_2 \sim N({p}_1−{p}_2,\sqrt{\hat{p}_{pool}(1−\hat{p}_{pool})(\frac{1}{n_1} +\frac{1}{n_2}}))$

## Calculate the pooled groups

$\widehat{p}_{pool} = \frac{25}{90}$

$SE = \sqrt{\widehat{p}_{pool}(1-\widehat{p}_{pool})(1/n_1+1/n_2)}$

```{r}
p_pool = 25/90
SE = sqrt(p_pool*(1-p_pool)*(1/50+1/40))
SE
```

## Find pvalue
Note that the distribution is different, because in a hypothesis test we assume the center is 0. 

${p}_1−{p}_2 \sim N(0,0.095)$

If the distribution is centered around the null parameter (eg 0, because we assume there is no difference) how likely is it that we would get 0.13 for a difference? 

```{r}
2*pnorm(q = 0.13, mean = 0, sd = SE, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

## Conclusion

Our pvalue is greater than 0.05 so we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no difference in survival rates between the treatment and control groups.

Note: It is possible we have made a Type 2 error in failing to reject the null even when the null was false.
