## Assignmnet

In this final R Assignment you will carry out a hypothesis test of a single mean using simulation, see the end of the videos on a single mean for the infer code.

You will do a hypothesis test of a single mean. Specifically you will answer the question was the unemployment rate in the US in 2017 4%? (This looks like it should be a proportion test, but you'll be finding the average proportion across counties.)


Use the county dataset in openintro for your data.
